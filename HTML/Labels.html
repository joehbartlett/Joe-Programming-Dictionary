    <h2>Labels</h2>
    <p>Labels will benefits those who use screen readers, which will read out loud the label, when the user is focused on the element. Also Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) - because when a user clicks the text within the label element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area). </p>
    <h2>Value</h2>
    <p>Defines a default value which will be displayed in the element on page load.</p>
    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>Name of the element. For example used by the server to identify the fields in form submits.</p>
    <h2>ID's</h2>
    <p>The id global attribute defines an identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).</p>
    <h2>Validations</h2>
    <h3>Required</h3>
    <p>Mandatory inputs should have the <em>required</em> attribute applied to them. This will ensure that people navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader will be able to understand which inputs need valid content to ensure a successful submission.</p>
    <h3>Custom Lengths</h3>
    <p>For <em>Textarea</em>'s, <em>Username</em>'s or <em>Password</em> inputs, a length attribute can be used - minlength or maxlength with a numerical value is added to the input.</p>
    <h3>Pattern</h3>
    <p>The pattern attribute specifies a regular expression the form control's value should match. If a non-null value doesn't conform to the constraints set by the pattern value, the  ValidityState object's read-only patternMismatch property will be true.</p>
